(?<!regex_2)regex-1
The negative lookbehind (?<!) asserts regex_1 not to be immediately preceded by regex_2. Lookbehind is excluded from the match (do not consume matches of regex_2), but only assert whether a match is possible or not.
Regex Pattern "(?<![a-z])[aeiou]" â†’ Test String "he1o"

Task
You have a test String S.
Write a regex which can match all the occurences of characters which are not immediately preceded by vowels (a, e, i, u, o, A, E, I, O, U).

Note
This is a regex only challenge. You are not required to write a code.
You have to fill the regex pattern in the blank (_________).

# Solution:
Regex_Pattern = r"(?<![aeiouAEIOU])[\s\S]"	# Do not delete 'r'.

import re
Test_String = input()
match = re.findall(Regex_Pattern, Test_String)
print("Number of matches :", len(match))
